**Project description:**

Many Educational Institutes conduct exams from time to time for student assessment. For this, they need an Assessment System for Education Institutes with all features to reduce the turnaround time to generate Exam question papers. A software that offers intelligent assessment tools that enable colleges and universities to create customized quizzes, tests, and assignments. With these assessment tools, educational institutions can streamline their exam paper preparation processes, saving time and enhancing overall efficiency.
